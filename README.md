# Online vehicle detection using gated recurrent units
This code corresponds to the implementation of the paper 'Online Vehicle Detection using Gated Recurrent Units,' which was presented at the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Smart Vehicle (ICAISV-2023).

Our model is implemented in Python, utilizing PyTorch for deep learning functionality, and it is executed on Google Colab.

Dataset Information:
Our paper's experiments were conducted using all the synthetic videos of the BMC2012 dataset, a benchmark dataset for outdoor foreground/background extraction.:

Dataset Title: A Benchmark Dataset for Outdoor Foreground/Background Extraction

Training and Evaluation:
For training and generating background and foreground scenes of each synthetic videos of the BMC2012 dataset, run the OGRU.ipynb file and just change the video file's name.
